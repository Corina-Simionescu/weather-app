A simple weather app project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app utilizes asynchronous JavaScript to fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on user input of a city. It displays the current temperature of the entered city along with its name. The project was created with the purpose of learning JavaScript, asynchronous programming, and API integration.
